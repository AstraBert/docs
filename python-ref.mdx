You can install **PdfItDown** by running the following command:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash pip
  pip install pdfitdown
  ```

```bash uv
uv pip install pdfitdown
```

</CodeGroup>

### Use PdfItDown within your script

Ypu should initialize PdfItDown by instantiating the `Converter` class:

```python
from pdfitdown.pdfconversion import Converter

converter = Converter()
```

After this, you can use PdfItDown to:

- Convert **single files** using the `convert` method:

```python
# adding a title for the PDF metadata
converter.convert(file_path = "business_grow.md", output_path = "business_growth.pdf", title="Business Growth for Q3 in 2024")
# without a title
converter.convert(file_path = "logo.png", output_path = "logo.pdf")
```

- Convert **multiple files** at once using the `multiple_convert` method:

```python
# with custom output paths
converter.multiple_convert(file_paths = ["business_grow.md", "logo.png"], output_paths = ["business_growth.pdf", "logo.pdf"])
# with inferred output paths
converter.multiple_convert(file_paths = ["business_grow.md", "logo.png"])
```

- Convert an **entire directory** at once using the `convert_directory` method:

```python
output_paths = converter.convert_directory(directory_path = "tests/data/testdir")
```

<Warning>
Be careful: all the documents that you convert need to be supported by PdfItDown, otherwise you'll see a `ValidationError`
